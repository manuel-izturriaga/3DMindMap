# 3D Mind Map

## Current Features

*   **3D Visualization:** A 3D environment built with Three.js for creating and visualizing mind maps.
*   **Node Creation:**
    *   Various node types (Trigger, Thoughts, Theme, Feeling, Whys, Solutions, Root Emotions) represented by different 3D geometries and colors.
    *   Node creation panel with type selection and notes input.
*   **Node Manipulation:**
    *   Click and drag nodes to reposition them within the 3D space.
*   **Node Connections:**
    *   Toggleable connection mode to create links between nodes.
    *   Visual representation of connections as lines between nodes.
*   **Node Information:**
    *   Info panes that display node category and allow adding/editing notes.
    *   Delete node option within the info pane.
*   **Save/Load:**
    *   Save the current mind map to a JSON file.
    *   Load a mind map from a JSON file.
*   **Camera Controls:** Orbit controls for navigating the 3D scene.

## Future Improvements

### Core Features

*   **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Implement undo/redo for node creation, deletion, and connection.
*   **Improved Node Styling:**
    *   More customization options for node appearance (size, color, shape).
    *   Dynamic node sizing based on content or importance.
*   **Advanced Connection Options:**
    *   Different connection styles (curved lines, arrows).
    *   Ability to label connections.
*   **Grouping and Clustering:**
    *   Group nodes together for better organization.
    *   Visual clustering of related nodes.
*   **Search Functionality:**
    *   Search for nodes based on category or notes content.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness:**
    *   Optimize the application for mobile devices and touch input.

### User Features

*   **User Authentication:**
    *   User registration and login.
    *   Secure storage of user data.
*   **Cloud Save/Load:**
    *   Save mind maps to a cloud database.
    *   Access mind maps from any device.
*   **Collaboration:**
    *   Real-time collaboration with multiple users.
    *   Shared mind maps with permission control.

### Technical Improvements

*   **Database Integration:**
    *   Use a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store user data and mind maps.
    *   Implement efficient data retrieval and storage mechanisms.
*   **Backend API:**
    *   Develop a RESTful API for handling user authentication, data storage, and collaboration features.
    *   Use a framework like Node.js with Express or Python with Flask/Django.
*   **Improved Performance:**
    *   Optimize rendering performance for large mind maps.
    *   Implement lazy loading for nodes and connections.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and stability.
*   **Code Refactoring:**
    *   Further modularize the codebase for better maintainability and scalability.

### Other Ideas

*   **Integration with other tools:**
    *   Export mind maps to other formats (e.g., PDF, image).
    *   Import data from other mind mapping applications.
*   **AI-powered features:**
    *   Automatic node placement and organization.
    *   Suggestions for related concepts based on existing nodes.
